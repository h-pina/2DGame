# Code Convetions:

    I chose to use a subsection of the Hungarian notation, to define only scopes. Variables will be named using camelCase.Also, the followiung prefixes will be used:

    g_variableName: for global variables
    s_variableName: for static variables
    m_variablename: For class variables



# ROADMAP/TODO
[x] - Setup Build System
[x] - Create a blank window
[-] - Render a Triangle from window 
    [x] - Create a Mesh class to store a specified VBA
    [ ] - Create a Shader class to store and manipulate Shader programs

[ ] - Create a InputHandler (or maybe controller?)
